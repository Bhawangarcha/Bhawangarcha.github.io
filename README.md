My experience in Excel through this online course is very nice. In this course I learn so many things and gain knowledge. Excel is a spreadsheet program. Microsoft Excel enables users to format, organise and calculate data in a spreadsheet ####

**Some functions every Excel should know**

1. **The Sum Function:** Excel sum function adds values. the sum function in excel adding rows or columns of numbers is something people do. So often that there is a button dedicated to the sum  function on Excel ribbon. select a cell adjacent to the numbers you want to do up then click the SUM button in the Home> Editing  group whenever you need to calculate a total

2. **The Average Function:** In Excel it's super handy for calculatingthe Average value of a range of numbers. we can use it  by typing "=AVERAGE ("in a cell and then selecting the range of cells you want to include in the Average calculation.  Excel will then display the Average value of those numbers. It's a quick and easy way to find the Average without having manuallyadd up all the numbers and divide by the count.

3. **The MIN Function:** The MIN function returns the lowest numbers in a range. In cell B10, type =MIN(B8:E8) and pressed enter. The lowest value in the range

4. **The MAX Function:**in Excel, the max function is really cool for finding the maximum value in a range of numbers. you can use it by typing g"=MAX(" in a cell and then selecting the range of cells you want to find the maximum value form. Excel will then show you the highest number in rht range.
